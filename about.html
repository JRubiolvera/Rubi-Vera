              <br>
                  I still remember the day that, when I handed in a drawing work, the teacher asked me if I was going to study Fine Arts (almost as if he wanted me to confirm that yes, maybe he thought I had talent hahaha), to which I replied: "No, Mr. teacher, I'm going to study Electronics". I have always liked everything related to the visual arts and I can not deny that I will always carry that thorn in my side, but anyway studying electronics has given me a basis for tinkering with computers since ancient times, when operating systems were just a string of commands. However it was and if each of my options at that time: Fine Arts and Electronics were two continuous lines, there would be a moment where destiny would cross them and that is where I am: doing this course that can be said to unite these two worlds. Ah! and my name is Francisco Javier, but you can call me Javi...
